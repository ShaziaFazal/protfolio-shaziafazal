# Portfolio Project

This is my portfolio project, showcasing my skills and work as a web developer. The portfolio is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and interactive web experience.

## Project Structure

The project is organized with the following directory structure:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point of the portfolio.
- `css/`: Contains the CSS files for styling the website.
- `js/`: Includes JavaScript files for adding interactivity and functionality.
- `images/`: Stores image files used in the portfolio.
- `projects/`: Houses individual project pages if multiple projects are featured.
- `about/`, `contact/`, `resume/`: Sections or pages dedicated to specific content.
- `404.html`: A custom 404 error page for handling non-existent URLs (optional).
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The portfolio is designed to work seamlessly on various screen sizes, including mobile devices and desktops, thanks to responsive HTML and CSS.
- **Interactive Elements**: JavaScript is used to add interactive elements, such as navigation menus, project showcases, and contact forms.
- **Project Showcase**: The "Projects" section displays your work with project cards or descriptions, with links to individual project pages.
